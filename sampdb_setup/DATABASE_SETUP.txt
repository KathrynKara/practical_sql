DESCRIPTION

This document describes loading the 'sampdb' sample database and
tables to a SQL database.

At the moment, the instructions only support loading the database to MySQL and
Postgres.  If you wish to load to another implementation, please tell me which
one and I will provide the appropriate files.

Note that loading the database requires access to a working database.  If you
lack this, see the SOFTWARE_INSTALLATION.txt in the directory above this for
information about installing MySQL.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETUP AND LOAD

See instructions in the directory for your particular implmentation.
