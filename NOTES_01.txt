This note accompanies additions of files to the repository package.

Additions are in or under the directory sessions/01, and include:
-   A PDF of last night's deck
-   Queries and files for loading a CSV file to a database -- see examples/load_csv
-   Exercises

The exercises are deliberately written to provide a range of difficulty.  A few
require obtaining external data and / or googling about SQL for yourself.
Please do the best you can with as many of these as you can.  Your efforts to
figure out the problems will help you grasp the concepts and tools we are
using.  Some of these problems point to issues of data management and analysis,
and our use of SQL to meet them.  You'll have better motivation for those
discussions if you've begun thinking about the problems before we begin those
discussions.

There is no need to submit your solutions.  If people are interested, we can
look at creating a channel for sharing and dicussion solutions among
yourselves.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have questions or are struggling.  I
want to help, and to keep an eye on the calibration of these exercises'
difficulty.
