PURPOSE
-------
This directory holds example queries for generating and loading an SQL database
table from a CSV file.

PROCESS
-------
Run these queries in this order:

- create_database_csv_load.sql
- create_table_simple.sql
- load_simple.sql

If all went well, the following should generate a result:
- select_from_csvl.sql


NOTE
----
Though one field is labeled 'date', the values of that field are of type
VARCHAR.  This means they are text, and in operations perform as we would
expect for text, rather than 'date', data.
