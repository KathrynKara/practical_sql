These files hold queries used in class, and a couple we didnt' get to.

Note that there are several versions of 01_simple, in different file formats.
I sometimes use these to demonstrate the differences in loading a text file and
a .doc file to a query editor.  Note also the size of these files -- if you
have query file sized in kilobytes, odds are good something is amiss.  (Data
file sizes, on the other hand, are an entirely different kettle of fish.)
